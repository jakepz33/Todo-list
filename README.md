# Todo-list

1. Adding webpack files to directory

   - in newly created directory run npm init -y, npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev

2. Creating a bundle

   - create dist/index.html and src/index.js

3. Running npx webpack takes our script at src/index.js as the entry point and generates dist/main.js as the output

   - npx webpack

4. Create a webpack.config.js file
   run npx webpack --config webpack.config.js
